### Quickstart

Following the guidelines of the Twelve Factor App (https://12factor.net/), environment variables are kept in a dotenv file at the root directory. When using Docker, the environment (such as the API_SECRET) is configured in the Docker Compose file. Note that the final image size of **the Docker image is only 8.52MB in size** thanks to a multi-staged build and UPX stripping.

````zsh
docker build -t koios .
docker tag koios:latest koios:staging
docker-compose up

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer API_SECRET" "http://localhost:1323/api/rate?user=u1&item=i1&rating=0.88"
````

### REST API Endpoints

- /api/rate?user=[uid]&item=[itemid]&rating=[amount]
